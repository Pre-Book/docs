# :material-hammer-wrench: Setup

!!! danger "This section is not finished!"

    Please wait until we finish building it.

## :material-book-cog: Choose a playbook

??? warning "Do not use the Ameliorated playbook!"

    This playbook leaves Windows in a very insecure (and potentially broken) state. 
    We highly recommend against using it.
    
    We do use the AME Wizard, but AME's own playbook for it should be avoided.
