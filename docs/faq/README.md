    We'll add more questions soon.

## :octicons-question-24: Quick Questions

??? question "What is this?"
   
    [PreBook](https://github.com/ast3risk-ops/prebook "Prebook") is an [NTLite](https://ntlite.com "NTLite official website") preset designed to be a stripped down base Windows for applying [AME](https://ameliorated.io "AME Wizard website") playbooks.
??? question "What is this for?"

    This is for if you want to install some AME playbook, but want a slimmer starting Windows (or base) designed to suit your needs. You can also use this standalone to have a lighter version of stock Windows.
??? question "What is supported?"

    Windows 10 and 11 Pro and Home (Pro strongly recommended, Home support is patchy at best).
??? question "Where can I get it?"

    You can download the latest builds from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Ast3risk-ops/PreBook/releases/latest).
??? question "Who made this?"

    [Asterisk](https://asterisk.shinken.studio "Asterisk's website") and [conaN](https://discord.com/users/779674532481990656 "conaN's Discord Profile").

## :material-book-outline: Origins

The playbook originally came about when conaN created an [NTLite](https://ntlite.com) preset for a minimalistic base ISO that [AtlasOS](https://atlasos.net "Hi Jack!") could be applied onto. I wanted to check it out, so he sent me a list of changes, which I compiled into a preset for Windows 10 (he had one for Windows 11).

Now Jack (AtlasOS maintainer/owner) wouldn't let us send presets in the discord, so we thought bigger, and PreBook came out of that.
