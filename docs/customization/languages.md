    According to [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/input/input-method-editors):
    > An Input Method Editor (IME) is a software component that enables a user to input text in a language that can't be represented easily on a standard QWERTY keyboard. This is typically due to the number of characters in the user's written language, such as the various East Asian languages.

    > Instead of each single character appearing on a single keyboard key, a user types combinations of keys that are interpreted by the IME. The IME generates either the character that matches the set of key strokes or a list of candidate characters to choose from. The selected character is then inserted into the edit control that the user is interacting with.
